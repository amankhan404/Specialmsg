        <p> To My Future Wife,

In last days i miss uh alot and you also missed meh , but I want you to think of me every time you drink from this mug.😊
Even if I’m not there, my love is always with you.💓
I miss you more than words can say, and I think about you every day.👀

When you feel lonely, hold this mug and remember that I’m always by your side in my heart.🌼💕

One day, we’ll wake up next to each other, and mornings will be even better.🤭

This mug will make uhh feel better and loved every time uhh drink tea from it. 

And small speakers is also very cute just like you ❤ Whenever uhh feel lonely just turn on the speaker and play some music, naat, nasheeed etc etc.... This is totally depends on you. 

Until then, stay strong and keep smiling—for me.

From, 
Aman Khan ❤</p>
